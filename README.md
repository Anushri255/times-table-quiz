# Times Table Quiz

This project is a simple Times Table Quiz built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz generates random multiplication questions and gives the user a limited amount of time to answer. After every 4 correct answers, the time allowed for answering the questions is reduced.

## Features

- **Random Multiplication Questions**: The quiz randomly generates multiplication questions involving numbers from 1 to 12.
- **Timer**: Each question must be answered within a certain time limit. The timer resets for each new question.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The time limit decreases after every 4 correct answers, making the quiz progressively harder.
- **Score Tracking**: The user's score is displayed and updated after each question.
